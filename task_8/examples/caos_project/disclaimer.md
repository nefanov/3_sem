CAOS Project 1: Message counter


Problem statement:

You need to write 2 programs: server program and client program.

Behaviour of the working solution:

   1.

   Firstly, you should start the server program and provide it with 1
   argument: serverâ€™s port
   2.

   Then, you connect with clients to the server. Server should be ready
   to receive the data from multiple clients and count the number of
   bytes that every client has sent to the server.
   3.

   Server should be able to accept new clients whenever the user
   connects to the server.
   4.

   After all the clients have disconnected from the server, it should
   print out the amounts of bytes that were received from every client
   separately. 5.

   Complete log of the working solution can be found here
